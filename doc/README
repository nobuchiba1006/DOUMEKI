Usage:

[0] Prerequisite to Use Jupiter

Jupiter is based on Geant4. You thus need to have Geant4
and related libraries such as CLHEP beforehand.
Install them first if not yet.
You also  need to set Geant4-related environmental variables 
by doing something like:

$ export G4INSTALL=<top directory of Geant4 distribution>, etc.

See Geant4 installation instructions for details.

Note that you need to create directories to store image files
according to G4DAWNFILE_DEST_DIR and/or G4VRMLFILE_DEST_DIR.

Finally you need to set up JUPITER-related env. vars.

$ export JUPITERROOT=<top directory of Jupiter distribution>


[1] How to Compile Jupiter

Given that Geant4 and Jupiter have been installed and
related environmental variables have been set accordingly, 
all you need to do is:

$ cd $JUPITERROOT
$ make

The binary executable will be placed as
        $JUPITERROOT/bin/$G4SYSTEM/Jupiter
You can clean it together with other objects by

$ make clean

Alternatively you can do this in $JUPITERROOT/sources/main
directory, where the main program Jupiter.cc resides.

[2] How to Run Jupiter

Type

$ $J4BABAYROOT/bin/$G4SYSTEM/Baby

then you will be prompted in a Baby interactive session.
Supply valid commands whose examples can be found in
$JUPITERROOT/macros/.

Enjoy!
