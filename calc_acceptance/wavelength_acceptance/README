* How to make wavelength_accepcance

1) Prepare dataset
   dataset must be placed ./data directory.
   symbolic link may work.
   Make directory named "eps" and "gif" under current dir.
   I recommend to generate them under ./data, and link it
   to current directory.
   e.g.
   $ ln -s <somewhere>/wavelength_accept_data/ data
   $ mkdir data/eps
   $ mkdir data/gif
   $ ln -s ./data/eps .
   $ ln -s ./data/gif .

   CAUTION:
   input data must have two field in the beginning of file:
   nevt 100 nrun 1000  or 
   nevt 1000 nrun 1000  or 
   depending on how you generate the files.
   DOMINANT doesn't fill these info, so you must do it by hand.
   (you can use modify.sh placed upper directory)

2) Make "input.list" file.
   The file contains all list of input file.
   The order of input file MUST BE ASCENDING ORDER of wavelength.
   e.g.
   ./data/eff_8mm_00deg_270nm.dat.modified
   ./data/eff_8mm_00deg_285nm.dat.modified
   ...

3) Calculate penetration factor.
   Type
   $ root -l
   > .x GenerateSurvivingCurve.C+

   Don't forget "+" after the scriptname.
   Otherwise the script is painfully slow!!

   Generated file name is penet.data.
   Don't change the name UNTIL 4) HAS DONE.

4) Generate angle_acceptance.data
   Type
   $ root -l plot_wavelength_acceptance.C

   This program draws TGraph of wavelength acceptance curve.
   It generates wavelength_acceptance_withoutQE.data.
   Rename it to avoid overwrite.
